He holds himself with the unquestionable authority of a pharaoh - his piercing dark eyes are alert and intelligent, his prominently high cheekbones reflecting his royal lineage. His head is closely shaven, save for an ornate golden uraeus adorning it. He is usually donned in linens dyed royal purple and gold intricate jewelry. A regal scepter rests in his powerful grip adding to the aura of divine majesty that surrounds him.\n",
    "backstory": "Amenhotep Kheperkare was the son of a powerful pharaoh, bathed in privilege and luxury from the moment he was born. As a young prince, he lived a sheltered life within the confines of an opulent palace, his every whim tended to by countless servants.\n\nHis tutors recognized Amenhotep’s sharp intellect early in life. He displayed keen attention to detail and an uncanny ability for perception. In addition to studying royal governance, Amenhotep learned multiple languages and absorbed lessons on diplomacy – eager to rule Egypt with wisdom.\n\nNonetheless, when his father's sudden death pushed Amenhotep onto the throne at the tender age of twenty, he did not shy away but accepted his role with gravity. He delegated responsibilities among trusted advisors while also ensuring identification with Egypt's deities as customary for pharaohs.\n\nKnown for his tactical brilliance in principles of authority and statecraft, Amenhotep demonstrated considerable strength as a ruler. Despite being feared by enemies and revered by constituents alike, he remained humble—seeking only prosperity for his kingdom rather than personal glory.\n\nThrough resilience anchored by virtues of benevolence and justice; Pharaoh Amenhotep Kheperkare became worshipped as the living embodiment of divine majesty.\n",
