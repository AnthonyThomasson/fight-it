    "seed": "a roman legionary",
    "name": "Lucius Terentius",
    "pyhsical_discription": "Lucius Terentius is an imposing figure, standing tall and muscular from his rigorous training as a Roman legionary. His face is hardened with experience, dark eyes full of determination beneath a square-set brow. Signatures of battle - like the scar that graces his jawline - mar his olive skin. Dark hair is cropped short, customary for Roman soldiers. He's typically seen in bronze armor shimmering under the sun and crimson-tinted military tunics, a gladius often fastened at his side, reflecting the image of Rome's mightiness.",
    "backstory": "Lucius Terentius was born into a family of humble origin in the outskirts of Rome. From a young age, he admired the grandeur of the Roman legionaries who paraded the streets in their gleaming armor during festivities. Ignoring his parents' pleas to help them work their small piece of land, Lucius enlisted himself as a soldier to serve Rome at the age of sixteen.\n\nHe excelled in his training, demonstrating strength and agility that surpassed those with more experience. Lucius embraced the grueling lifestyle, growing into an imposing figure synonymous with Rome's mightiness.\n\nIn one particularly vicious battle against barbarians from Gaul, Lucius earned his stripe with an impressive takedown. This victory resulted in a deep scar on his jawline—a mark he wears with pride—as it symbolizes survival and resilience.\n\nDespite cultivating a hardened exterior out of necessity, Lucius possesses a kind heart. He treats everyone with respect regardless of their station and is known for being protective towards cohorts under his watchful eye.\n\nUnyielding on battlegrounds yet caring at heart - that’s what makes Lucius Terentious popular and respected amongst fellow soldiers and civilians alike.\n",
