    "seed": "A middle-aged, male, office worker",
    "name": "Richard Thompson",
    "pyhsical_discription": "Richard Thompson is a middle-aged man with receding, salt-and-pepper hair and faint crow's feet around his alert blue eyes. He stands with a slight slouch that speaks to countless hours at a desk. His preferred attire is an array of neatly-pressed shirts paired with subdued ties and clean slacks. The spectacles perched on the bridge of his nose are both a necessity for his waning vision and an unwelcome confirmation of advancing years. His overall appearance paints the image of an ordinary, hard-working office worker.\n",
    "backstory": "Born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, Richard Thompson was a diligent student and later graduated from a local community college. He endured employment spells at retail jobs before climbing the corporate ladder to a stable, but monotonous desk job.\n\nRichard built himself into an efficient office worker – handling numerous tasks without missing deadlines. This simple yet diligent man favors utilitarian clothes—he is perfectly comfortable in neatly-pressed shirts, subdued ties, and clean slacks—the standard uniform for office workers that scream reliability and understated elegance.\n\nWhile his spectacles highlight aging eyes strained by years spent combing through endless papers under harsh office lighting; they also tell stories of late-night project work managing to meet relentless deadlines.\n\nHis job has molded him into a figure easily recognizable as his stooped stance indicates countless hours hunched over reports, emails, and proposals. Despite grievances about the high stress and low thanks environment typical of corporate life; Richard stays dedicated to his role—trying earnestly to balance it with his personal life—a faithful family man settling in ordinary routine while cherishing extraordinary moments shared with loved ones.",
