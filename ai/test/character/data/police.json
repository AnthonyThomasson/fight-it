    "pyhsical_discription": "Daniel \"Danny\" Collins is of average height, broad-shouldered with a muscular build worn by years of street patrols. His black hair is peppered with gray, kept short and neat. Behind spectacles are tired, blue eyes reflecting the strain of a cop's life on his weathered face filled with stubble. Danny’s navy-blue uniform carries badges as testament to his service while it's constant crease speaks volumes about his restless nights. A constant hint of stress in his stout demeanor makes him appear more troubled than most officers.\n",
    "backstory": "Daniel \"Danny\" Collins was born and bred in the grimy back alleys of Boston. The son of an Irish dockworker, he learned about struggle and poverty from a tender age. Exposed to an environment rife with crime, Danny felt the call to bring peace to his neighborhood, leading him to join the Boston Police Department.\n\nThroughout his two-decade-long career, Danny incorporated himself with various facets of police work—from street patrols to, ultimately, homicide investigation. He lived through countless risky encounters that slowly chipped away at his once bright-eyed enthusiasm. His unyielding commitment and devotion have earned him numerous badges adorning his creased uniform—a testament to his bravery among other officers.\n\nHowever, every unfortunate incident he dealt with left a permanent scar on him; those sunken blue eyes reflecting bone-deep exhaustion tell tales better than any words can explain. The restless nights spent mulling over unsolved cases added streaks of grey hair earlier than age would have naturally allowed.\n\nDespite all odds that came en route, Danny continues persevering in pursuit of justice—remaining a stalwart guardian for citizens despite appearing significantly more troubled than most officers.\n",
